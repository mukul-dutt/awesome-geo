# Awesome GEO [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of resources for **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** — optimizing content so generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, and Copilot retrieve, synthesize, and cite it in their answers.

GEO is the term academic research settled on for this discipline, and the one Wikipedia treats as canonical (with AEO, LLMO, AIO, and "AI SEO" redirecting to it). This list collects the research, official documentation, tools, and communities that define the field as it stands in mid-2026. Contributions welcome — see [Contributing](#contributing).

## What Is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization is the practice of shaping content, structure, and distribution so that generative AI systems select, trust, and cite it when synthesizing an answer — rather than simply ranking it in a list of links. It was defined as an academic discipline before it became a marketing buzzword, which is part of why it has the clearest research foundation of the AI-search terms in circulation.

Naming in this space is still a little tangled:

- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** — the term coined in the founding Princeton/Georgia Tech/Allen Institute/IIT Delhi research; Wikipedia standardizes on GEO, with AEO, LLMO, AIO, and "AI SEO" all redirecting to it.
- **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** — the term most marketers and content teams reach for; used more or less interchangeably with GEO in practice.
- **LLMO (LLM Optimization)** — favored by some developer-tool builders.
- Google's own Search Central documentation maintains that none of this is a distinct discipline — it's still SEO, applied to a new answer surface.

Functionally, the work is the same regardless of label: structure content around clear, evidence-backed answers, and make sure the AI systems that matter can actually reach and parse your pages.

## Foundational Research

- [**GEO: Generative Engine Optimization**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735) — The paper that defined the field. Researchers from Princeton, Georgia Tech, the Allen Institute for AI, and IIT Delhi (Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024) ran ~10,000 queries through generative engines, tested nine content-modification strategies, and introduced the "impression score" and **GEO-BENCH** benchmark for measuring visibility inside AI-generated answers. The strongest tactics — citing sources, adding statistics, including quotations — lifted visibility by up to 40%.
- [**AgentGEO — Diagnosing and Repairing Citation Failures in GEO**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.09296) — Introduces the first taxonomy of *why* a document fails to get cited (rather than just measuring influence) and an agentic system that diagnoses and repairs those failures, improving citation rates by 40%+ while touching only ~5% of content.
- **AutoGEO** *(ICLR 2026)* — A framework that automatically learns what a given generative engine prefers, rather than relying on a fixed set of heuristics, and rewrites content accordingly.
- [**E-GEO: A Testbed for GEO in E-Commerce**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20867) — The first e-commerce-specific GEO benchmark, evaluating rewriting heuristics across 7,000+ product queries.
- **Multi-Source Corroboration in GEO** *(Rankfor.AI, 2026)* — Empirical study on cross-platform citation optimization, finding large citation-rate gains when consistent information appears across 5–10 independent, high-authority sources.
- [**Awesome-GEO** by DavidHuji](https://github.com/DavidHuji/Awesome-GEO) — An actively maintained, deeper research-paper collection covering adversarial GEO topics (ranking manipulation, prompt injection risks) alongside the core visibility literature — a good companion for anyone going past the practitioner layer.

## Official Platform Documentation

- [Google Search Central — AI features & Search](https://developers.google.com/search) — Google's own guidance for AI Overviews, grounded in its existing indexing and E-E-A-T framework; Google has publicly stated it does not treat GEO as a separate discipline from SEO.
- [OpenAI — Crawlers documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots) — Documents `GPTBot` (model training), `OAI-SearchBot` (ChatGPT search indexing), and `ChatGPT-User` (user-triggered browsing) as independently controllable crawlers.
- [Perplexity — Bots & crawling](https://docs.perplexity.ai/) — Distinguishes `PerplexityBot` (indexing for answers) from `Perplexity-User` (real-time, user-triggered fetches).
- [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) — The structured-data vocabulary (`FAQPage`, `HowTo`, `Article`, `Product`, etc.) generative engines and rich-result systems parse.
- [Bing Webmaster Tools / Copilot documentation](https://www.bing.com/webmasters) — Microsoft's crawler and indexing guidance relevant to Copilot's generated answers.

## Tools & Platforms

### AI Visibility Platforms

## Technical Implementation

Practical, engine-agnostic groundwork that most GEO research and guides converge on:

- **Cite sources for claims** — The single most consistently effective tactic in the founding Princeton GEO study; treat every verifiable assertion as something that needs an attributed source.
- **Replace vague claims with specific numbers** — "Many companies struggle with this" is far weaker GEO material than a named study with a precise figure.
- **Structured data** — Implement `FAQPage`, `HowTo`, `Article`, and `Product` schema (JSON-LD) so generative engines get explicit entity and relationship data; schema should reflect what's actually visible on the page.
- **Freshness signals** — Real-time engines like Perplexity disproportionately cite recently published or updated content; visible date signals in titles and headings measurably improve citation rates.
- **`llms.txt`** — A proposed (not yet standardized) Markdown file at a site's root pointing AI systems to its most important content. Adoption is genuinely mixed — Google has said it doesn't use it and has no plans to — so treat it as low-cost hygiene, not core GEO strategy.
- **Crawler access management** — Deliberately allow or block AI bots in `robots.txt`: `GPTBot` / `OAI-SearchBot` (OpenAI), `PerplexityBot` (Perplexity), `ClaudeBot` (Anthropic), `Google-Extended` (Google's AI training, separate from the `Googlebot` that powers AI Overviews), and `Bytespider` (ByteDance). Blocking the wrong one can make a site invisible to an entire generative engine.
- **Wide corroboration** — Consistent information repeated across several independent, high-authority sources measurably improves citation odds versus a single, isolated mention.
